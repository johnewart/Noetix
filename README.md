Noetix is intended to be a powerful, intuitive C# framework designed to simplify the creation and management of AI agents. Derived from the term "noetic" (relating to mental activity or intellect), Noetix provides developers with robust tools to build, deploy, and orchestrate intelligent agents. 

## Features 

- ðŸš€ **Agent Creation** - Build AI agents with minimal code (examples provided in Examples/) 
- **Flexible Architecture** - Easily add tools, tasks and knowledge to agents with minimal code
- ðŸ§  **Knowledgebase / RAG** - Includes a knowledgebase and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for imparting agents with knowledge. Includes built-in tools for searching and updating the knowledgebase so that agents can learn and adapt. 

## Plans
- ðŸ’¬ **Communication Framework** - Built-in agent-to-agent communication protocols
- ðŸ”„ **Pipelines** - Ability to build a pipeline for agents to manage and prioritize tasks
